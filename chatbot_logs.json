            "That leaf shows signs of **early blight**, a common fungal disease affecting many plants, including tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers.",
            "The characteristic symptoms visible in the image are the **dark brown to purplish-brown lesions** with concentric rings (target-like spots).  These lesions often start small and then expand, eventually coalescing to cover large portions of the leaf.  The lesions are typically found on the leaves, stems, and fruits.",
            "Early blight can significantly reduce crop yield and quality if left unchecked."
